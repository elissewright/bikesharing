# NYC CitiBike Analysis 

## Overview:
### CitiBike is  a popular bike-share company based in New York City. Users can rent a bike by the hour, or subscribe for regular use. CitiBike is planning to exapand to other locations, including Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis was performed in order to evaluate key metrics of CitiBike customers and use in the NYC location. [The results](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elissewright/viz/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge_16717421039640/CitiBikeKeyMetrics?publish=yes) may help the company pinpoint areas to focus on in order to best succeed in Des Moines and other markets. 

## Results:
* Checkout times by overall users, and by gender: Checkout times are on average, under an hour per user. When stratified by gender, typical checkout times do not vary between male, female, and other users; however, males appear to make up the largest proportion of users. 
* Trips by weekday and hour: For most weekdays, peak use times tend to be from 7-10am, and from 5-7pm. On weekends, 11am-5pm are more popular times for utilization. 12-5am is the least popular time block across all days.

* Trips by weekday and hour, stratified by gender: A gender breakdown of peak hours again reveals that CitiBike is more popular among male customers than females and individuals who identify as other. The peak hour distributions tend to remain the same for all genders, however, with highest use times around 7-9am and 5-7pm on weekdays for men and women. Individuals within the other gender category may be more likely to utilize CitiBike on weekends.  
* Trips by weekday and hour, stratified by gender and user type: A breakdown of user type shows that, with few exceptions, CitiBike is much more heavily utilized by male subscribers as opposed to casual customers, or users of other gender types.  
* Top starting and ending locations: Maps show that there is a significant overlap between top starting and ending locations by longitude and latitude, suggesting many users are taking round trips at these stations.

## Summary: 
### This analysis revealed several key statistics about CitiBike users. The average user is likely to identify as male, be a long-term subscriber to the service, and utilize it for short trips. The average trip duration and peak hours within mornings and late afternoons of weekdays suggest that most customers are primarily using CitiBike for work commutes. Male, working-class customers may be a good demographic to reach with targeted social media ads, but CitiBike may also want to focus on reaching out to other demographics, such as tourists and the fitness community. 
### The overlap between popular start and end locations also suggests that many users are taking round trips at these stations. Additional analysis of type of neighborhood where these stations are located (i.e. residential or commercial) may offer further guidance on why stations in these areas are popular, suggesting similar areas in other cities where stations may be highly utilized. 
### A major limitation of this analysis was that it was restricted to the month of August. A future analysis may include an evaluation of peak use trends across an entire year, revealing which months are more popular and may be a better time to launch the service in a new city.
